# Chapter 1: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

## What is AI?

A broad and optimistic definition of the field of AI could be: "the area of computer science that studies how machines can perform tasks that would normally require a sentient agent."

- This implies that something as simple as a computer mutliplying two numbers is "artificial intelligence".

A more skeptical definition might be more narrow, for ecample: "the area of computer science that studies how machines can closely imitate human intelligence."

## Why do we need to study AI?

The field of AI tries to understand patterns and behaviors of entities. With AI, we want to build smart systems and understand the concept of intelligence as well.

The good thing about AI is that an idealized model for it already exists: our brain is the holy grail of an intelligent system! All we have to do is to mimic its functionality to create an intelligent system that can do something similarly to, or better than, our brain.

Data --Processing--> Information --Cognition--> Knowledge --Pattern extraction--> Understanding --Inference--> Intelligence

One of the main reasons we want to study AI is to automate many things. We live in a world where:

- We deal with huge and insurmountable amounts of data. The human brain can't keep track of so much data.
- Data originates from multiple sources simultaneously. The data is unorganized and chaotic.
- Knowledge derived from this data must be updated constantly because the data itself keeps changing.
- The sensing and actuation must happen in real-time with high precision.

We need AI systems that can:

- Handle large amounts of data in an efficient way. With the advent of Cloud Computing, we are now able to store huge amounts of data.
- Ingest data simultaneously from multiple sources without any lag. Index and organize data in a way that allows us to derive insights.
- - Learn from new data and update constantly using the right learning algorithms. Think and respond to situations based on the conditions in real time.
- Continue with tasks without getting tired of needing breaks.

## Branches of AI

- Supervised learning vs. unsupervised learning vs. reinforcement learning
- Artificial general intelligence vs. narrow intelligence
- By human function:
  - Machine vision
  - Machine learning
  - Natural language processing
  - Natural language generation

- **Machine learning and pattern recognition:** Design and develop software that can learn from data. Based on these learning models, perform predictions on unknown data. One of the main constraints here is that these programs are limited to the power of the data.
- **Logic-based AI:** Mathematical logic is used to execute computer programs in logic-based AI. A program written in logic-based AI is basically a set of statements in logical form that expresses facts and rules about a problem domain. This is extensively in pattern matching, language parsing, semantic analysis, and so on.
- **Search:** Search techniques are used extensively in AI programs. These programs examine many possibilities and then pick the most optimal path.
- **Knowledge representation:** The facts about the world need to be represented in some way for a system to make sense of them. The languages of mathematical logic are frequently used here.
- **Planning:** This field deals with optimal planning that gives us maximum returns with minimal costs.
- **Heuristics:** A heuristic is a technique used to solve a given problem that's practical and useful in solving the problem in the short term, but not guaranteed to be optimal. In AI, we frequently encounter situations where we cannot check every single possibility to pick the best option. Thus, we need to use heuristics to acieve the goal. They are used extensively in AI in fields such as robotics, search engines, and so on.
- **Genetic programming:** Genetic programming is a way to get programs to solve a task by mating programs and selecting the fittest. The programs are encoded as a set of genes, using an algorithm to get a program that can perform the given task well.
