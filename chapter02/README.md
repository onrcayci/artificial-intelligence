# Fundamental Use Cases for Artificial Intelligence

## Digital personal assistants and chatbots

- **Google Assistant:** one of the most advanced chatbots available.
- **Amazon Alexa**
- **Apple Siri**
- **Microsoft Cortana**

All of these assistants will allow you to perform all or at least most of these tasks:

- Control devices in your home
- Play music and display videos on command
- Set timers and reminders
- Make appointments
- Send text and email messages
- Make phone calls
- Open applications
- Read notifications
- Perform translations
- Order from e-commerce sites

## Personal chauffeur

Self-driving or driverless cars are vehicles that can travel along a pre-established route with no human assistance.

SAE International has created standard J3016, which defines six levels of automation for cars that automakers, suppliers, and plicymakers can use the same language to classify the vehicle's level of sophistication:

- **Level 0 (no automation)**
- **Level 1 (driver assitance)**
- **Level 2 (Partial automation)**
- **Level 3 (conditional automation)**
- **Level 4 (high automation)**
- **Level 5 (full automation)**

## Shipping and warehouse management

An Amazon sorting facility is one of the best examples of the symbiotic relationship that is forming between humans, computers, and robots. Computers take customer orders and decide where to route merchandise, the robots act as mules carrying the pallets and inveotry around the warehouse. Humans plug the "last mile" problem by hand picking the items that are going into each order.

## Human health

- **Drug discovery**: AI can assist in generating drug canditates (that is, molecules to be tested for medical application) and then quickly eliminating some of them using constraint satisfaction or experiment simulation.
- **Insurance pricing**: Machine learning algorithms can be used to better price insurance by more accurately predicting how much will be spent on a patient, how good a driver an individual is, or how long a person will live.
- **Patient diagnosis**: Doctors can make better diagnosis on their patients and be more productive in their practice by using sophisticated rules engines and machine learning.
- **Medical imaging interpretation**: Medical imaging data is a complex and rich source of information about patients.
- **Psychiatric analysis**: We are on the cusp of being able to simulate the behavior with AI chatbots. At the very least, these bots will be able to offer follow-up care from the sessions with the psychiatrist and help with a patient's care between doctor's visits.
- **Smart health records**
- **Disease detection and prediction**

## Knowledge search

- Google search

## Recommendation systems

What is a recommendation? Recommendation is the answer to questions like "waht is your favorite movie?" or "do you like radishes?" which are completely subjective and the answer is going to depend on the person answering the question.

One of the ways that a recommender system can improve is by having previous selections from users of the system.

An important component of good recommendation systems is a randomization factor that occasionally "goes out on a limb" and makes oddball recommendations that might not be that related to the initial user's choices. Recommender systems don't just learn from history to find similar recommendations, but they also attempt to make new recommendations that might not be related at first blush.

Some of the areas where recommendations can benefit from these systems are:

- Restaurants
- Movies
- Music
- Potential partners (online dating)
- Books and articles
- Search results
- Financial services (robo-advisors)

Examples:

- Netflix recommendations
- Spotify
- Betterment

## The smart home

Some of the tasks that the automation will need to perform in order to be proficient:

- Wash and dry clothes
- Fold clothes
- Cook dinner
- Make beds
- Pick up items off the floor
- Mop, dust and vacuum
- Wash dishes
- Monitor the home

## Gaming

Humans are competititve by nature and having machines beat us at our own games is an interesting yardstick to measure the breakthroughs in the field. Some examples of the AI systems:

- StartCraft 2
  - AlphaStar AI
  - While StarCraft is just a game, albeit a difficult one, the concepts and techniques coming out of AlphaStar can be useful in solving other real-world challenges. As an example, AlphaStar's architecture is capable of modeling very long sequences of likely actions - with games often lasting up to an hour with tens of thousands of moves - based on imperfect information. The primary concept of making complicated predictions over long sequences of data can be found in many real-world problems, such as:
    - Weather prediction
    - Climate modelling
    - Natural Language Understanding
- Jeopardy
  - IBM and the Watson team
  - The software architecture of Watson uses:
    - IBM's DeepQA software
    - Apache UIMA (Unstructured Information Management Architecture)
    - A variety of languages, including Java, C++, and Prolog
    - Apache Hadoop for distributed computing
- Chess
  - Deep Blue
    - Beat Gary Kasparov
  - AlphaZero from Google
- AlphaGo

## Movie making

- Deepfakes
  - A deepfake is a blend of "deep learning" and "fake." A common application is to overlap someone's face onto another. It can also be used to create fake news or hoaxes.
- Movie Script Generation
  - Sunspring is an experimental sience fiction short film released in 2016. It was entirely written by using deep learning techniques. The film's script was created using a **long short-term memory (LSTM)** model dubbed Benjamin.

## Underwriting and deal analysis

Underwriting is the process by which an institution determines if they want to take a financial risk in exchange for a premium. Examples of transactions that require underwriting are:

- Issuing an insurance policy
  - Health
  - Life
  - Home
  - Driving
- Loans
  - Installment loans
  - Credit cards
  - Mortgages
  - Commercial lines of credit
- Security underwriting and Initial Public Offerings (IPOs)

An interesting example of a company that specializes in this space is Zest Finance. Zest Finance uses AI techniques to assist lenders with their underwriting. AI can help to increase revenue and reduce risk. Most importantly well applied AI in general and Zest Finance in particular can help companies to ensure that the AI models used are compliant with a country's regulations.

## Data cleansing and transformation

Having clean and accurate data is paramount to producing consistent, reproducible, and accurate AI models. It is said that a data scientist spends about 80% of their time cleaning, preparing, and transforming their input data nad 20% of the time running and optimizing their models.

One example:

- Amazon Lake Foundation: automates some of the steps typically involved in the creation of a data lake including the collection, cleansing, deduplication, cataloging, and publication of data.
