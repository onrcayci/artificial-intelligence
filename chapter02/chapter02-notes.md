# Fundamental Use Cases for Artificial Intelligence

## Digital personal assistants and chatbots

- **Google Assistant:** one of the most advanced chatbots available.
- **Amazon Alexa**
- **Apple Siri**
- **Microsoft Cortana**

All of these assistants will allow you to perform all or at least most of these tasks:
- Control devices in your home
- Play music and display videos on command
- Set timers and reminders
- Make appointments
- Send text and email messages
- Make phone calls
- Open applications
- Read notifications
- Perform translations
- Order from e-commerce sites

## Personal chauffeur

Self-driving or driverless cars are vehicles that can travel along a pre-established route with no human assistance.

SAE International has created standard J3016, which defines six levels of automation for cars that automakers, suppliers, and plicymakers can use the same language to classify the vehicle's level of sophistication:
- **Level 0 (no automation)**
- **Level 1 (driver assitance)**
- **Level 2 (Partial automation)**
- **Level 3 (conditional automation)**
- **Level 4 (high automation)**
- **Level 5 (full automation)**

## Shipping and warehouse management

An Amazon sorting facility is one of the best examples of the symbiotic relationship that is forming between humans, computers, and robots. Computers take customer orders and decide where to route merchandise, the robots act as mules carrying the pallets and inveotry around the warehouse. Humans plug the "last mile" problem by hand picking the items that are going into each order.

## Human health

- **Drug discovery**: AI can assist in generating drug canditates (that is, molecules to be tested for medical application) and then quickly eliminating some of them using constraint satisfaction or experiment simulation.
- **Insurance pricing**: Machine learning algorithms can be used to better price insurance by more accurately predicting how much will be spent on a patient, how good a driver an individual is, or how long a person will live.
- **Patient diagnosis**: Doctors can make better diagnosis on their patients and be more productive in their practice by using sophisticated rules engines and machine learning.
- **Medical imaging interpretation**: Medical imaging data is a complex and rich source of information about patients.
- **Psychiatric analysis**: We are on the cusp of being able to simulate the behavior with AI chatbots. At the very least, these bots will be able to offer follow-up care from the sessions with the psychiatrist and help with a patient's care between doctor's visits.
- **Smart health records**
- **Disease detection and prediction**
